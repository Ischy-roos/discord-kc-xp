# Discord Kill count and Xp Notifier

This RuneLite plugin sends a notification to a discord Server each time an XP threshold is passed, if a level 99 is achieved or if you get a boss kill count.

In order to use this plugin you will need to create a webhook on your discord server. Below are instructions for how to do so:

1. Open your Server Settings and head into the Integrations tab
2. Click the "Create Webhook" button to create a new webhook
3. Once created, copy the webhook URL and insert into the "Webhook URL" box in the plugin's configuration in RuneLite.
